# 🚦 Traffic Light Simulator (Java Swing)

A GUI-based traffic light simulation built using Java and Swing. The project visually demonstrates timed traffic light transitions, object-oriented design, and event-driven programming. Designed to replicate a simple real-world intersection logic system in a controlled environment.
